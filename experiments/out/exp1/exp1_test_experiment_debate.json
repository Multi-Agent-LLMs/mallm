This solution takes into account the influence of Shelley's work on Thoreau and Gandhi, while also recognizing Thoreau's own unique approach to advocating for social justice.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a slight modification to the solution. Instead of merely drawing 'heavily' from Shelley's work, I propose that Thoreau would extensively utilize Shelley's imagery, language, and ideas in his own writing and speeches, adapting them to fit the specific needs and context of the Indian independence movement. This would allow Thoreau to effectively convey his message of nonviolent resistance to a broad audience, while also acknowledging the influence of Shelley's work on his own thought and activism.\n\nTherefore, my revised solution is: Thoreau would extensively utilize Percy Shelley's Masque of Anarchy, adapting its imagery, language, and ideas to fit the specific needs and context of the Indian independence movement, in order to inspire and justify nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience.[/INST]\n[INST]Literary Analyst:   I DISAGREE with the current solution, 'Percy Shelley's Masque of Anarchy,' because it oversimplifies the connection between Shelley's work and Thoreau's ideas. As a Literary Analyst, I suggest that Thoreau would not only draw inspiration from Shelley's work but also engage in a dialogue with it, adapting and transforming its ideas to fit his own vision of civil disobedience.\n\nNew Solution: Thoreau would creatively appropriate elements of Shelley's The Mask of Anarchy, such as the image of the ' Masque of Anarchy' itself, and incorporate them into his own writing, using them as a powerful tool to galvanize the Indian people and inspire them to resist oppression through nonviolent means. By doing so, Thoreau would not only pay homage to Shelley's work but also transform its messages to suit the unique context of India's struggle for freedom.[/INST]\nPolitical Scientist (you):   As a Political Scientist, I AGREE with the revised solution proposed by the Literary Analyst.

Thoreau would indeed draw inspiration from Shelley's The Mask of Anarchy, specifically its condemnation of oppressive authority and its call for nonviolent resistance. He would adapt and transform these ideas to fit his own vision of civil disobedience, emphasizing the importance of individual conscience and the need for collective action to bring about social change. Thoreau would use Shelley's imagery and language to inspire and justify nonviolent resistance in India, while also adding his own unique perspective and approach to advocating for social justice.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a slight modification to the solution. Instead of merely adapting and transforming Shelley's ideas, Thoreau would engage in a creative dialogue with The Mask of Anarchy, responding to its themes and ideas in his own writing and speeches, and incorporating elements of it in his own unique way. This approach would allow Thoreau to not only pay homage to Shelley's work but also to develop his own distinct perspective on nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience.\n\nNew Solution: Thoreau would engage in a creative dialogue with Percy Shelley's The Mask of Anarchy, responding to its themes of nonviolent resistance and the rejection of oppressive authority, and incorporate elements of it in his own writing and speeches, tailoring the message to suit the specific needs of his audience and the political climate of India.
