However, I also recognize that consumers may still prefer physical media, and a hybrid option could be a viable solution. A combination of physical and digital storage could offer consumers the best of both worlds, providing the convenience of digital storage and the tactile experience of physical media. This could potentially prolong the life of the compact disc, as consumers who prefer physical media could continue to purchase and use them alongside digital distribution methods.\n\nHere's a new solution: Companies could develop a new type of physical media that incorporates advanced material science, similar to the 3D stacking of two-dimensional materials suggested by the materials scientist. This new media could offer higher storage capacities and faster data transfer rates than traditional compact discs, making it an attractive option for consumers who desire physical media. Additionally, the new media could be designed to be more durable and resistant to scratches or damage, further enhancing its appeal to consumers who value physical media.
